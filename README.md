Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Marciano, Im a 40-year-old Backend Engineer with 11 years of experience, most of this time I spent working with Java and JDK technologies, in the last 2 years and a half I worked with Kotlin, Python and AWS to built microservices.

I'm currently learning about GoLang and Crypto Currencies.
I believe that technology can improve people lives and create a better world for everyone.
